\chapter{Introduction}
%=====================

%--------------------
\section{Overview}
%--------------------

The ``\ltbvcplugins'' package provides Lua plugins for being used in
the Reaper DAW~\cite{reference:reaper}; they assist in using the
\ltbvcLong\ tool chain for generating notation videos from arrangement
text files.

\ltbvcLong\ (or short \ltbvc,
\cite{reference:lilypondToBandVideoConverter}) is a command line audio
processing tool written in Python for Unix, Windows and Mac OS that
uses standard command-line tools to convert a music piece (a song)
written in the lilypond notation to

\begin{itemize}
    \item a PDF score of the whole song,
    \item several PDF voice extracts,
    \item a MIDI file with all voices (with additional preprocessing
          applied to achieve some humanization),
    \item audio mix files with several subsets of voices (specified
          by configuration), and
    \item video files for several output targets visualizing the score
          notation pages and having the mixes as mutually selectable
          audio tracks as backing tracks.
\end{itemize}

Because that command-line oriented approach is a bit tedious, the
current package provides several scripts for the Reaper DAW to make
this process easier.

%-----------------------------
\section{Available Scripts}
%-----------------------------

The following scripts are provided:
\begin{ttDescription}

    \item[AdaptTracksToLTBVCConventions.lua:] applies specific theme
         and layouts to the tracks and routes audio according to LTBVC
         conventions,
  
    \item[AdjustSoXEffectNames.lua:] sets the effect names of the SoX
         effects to the command line strings required for processing
         outside of the Reaper DAW,
  
    \item[ExportLilypond.lua:] transforms the notes of the selected
         MIDI item into a textual lilypond note/chord sequence and
         returns them in a text box,
  
    \item[ImportMidi.lua:] scans the current project for tracks with
         single MIDI items with names conforming to some pattern and
         replaces those by the corresponding track in an associated
         MIDI file filtering out unwanted MIDI items before import,

    \item[MakeRegionsFromRegionStructureTrack.lua:] either makes
         regions based on a track with structural MIDI items or
         generates that region structure track with MIDI items from
         the current regions, and

    \item[NormalizeStructuredVoiceTracks.lua:] scans all tracks with
         some specific prefix and normalizes their enclosed MIDI items
         by removing reverb, chorus and delay control codes, setting
         note velocities to some default and quantizing the note start
         and end positions.

\end{ttDescription}

%====================================
\chapter{Installation of the Plugins}
%====================================

The installation is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Copy the \ltbvcplugins\ archive from the repository in
          \cite{reference:ltbvcPlugins} and unpack it to some
          temporary directory.
  
    \item Close the Reaper application (if open).

    \item Copy the lua-files from the archive subdirectory
          \embeddedCode{src} into the \embeddedCode{Lua} sub-directory
          of the Reaper installation (typically in \embeddedCode{\bsl
          Program Files\bsl Reaper\bsl Lua} or
          \embeddedCode{/Applications/Reaper.app/Lua} in MacOS).

    \item If helpful, also copy the documentation file from the
          archive subdirectory \embeddedCode{doc} to the
          \embeddedCode{Lua} sub-directory.

    \item Restart Reaper.  You should now be able to access the
          scripts as actions in the Actions menu of Reaper.  It is
          helpful to define some keyboard shortcuts for those actions
          for a quicker access.

\end{enumerate}

Alternatively ---~and a little bit easier~--- you can use the ReaPack
plugin \cite{reference:reapack} and do an automatic install via the
\embeddedCode{index.xml} file in the repository
\cite{reference:ltbvcPlugins}.  After the installation via ReaPack all
the scripts can be found in the action list of the Reaper installation
via the prefix \embeddedCode{LTBVCPlugins\_}; so, for example, the
lilypond export script has the action name
\embeddedCode{LTBVCPlugins\_ExportLilypond.lua}.

\section{Motivation for the Plugins}
\label{section:motivation}
%-----------------------------------

Motivation for all the scripts presented here is to allow input and
adaptation of MIDI notes of some arrangement in the Reaper DAW, but
then easily integrate that into a \ltbvc\ pipeline.  Part of this
approach is also that one can quickly import the tracks of the
generated MIDI file from that external pipeline for checking whether
the \ltbvc\ and the DAW project are in sync.

To be able to do this, one should first organize MIDI items in the DAW
corresponding to the voices and the musical structure of the piece
into \emph{structured voice tracks}.  It is also helpful when the
names of those tracks adhere to some naming pattern (because one of
the tools relies on that).

When you have your project organized in such a way is then possible to
\begin{itemize}

    \item reflect the musical structure as regions based on the items
          in some track (see section~\ref{section:makeRegions}),

    \item sets the tracks' layouts in the mixer according to LTBVC
          conventions and routes the audio accordingly (see
          section~\ref{section:adaptTrackLayouts}),

    \item normalize the structured voice tracks by removing unwanted
          control codes and quantizing the note positions to a raster
          compatible with the later lilypond export (see
          section~\ref{section:normalizeTracks}),

    \item export MIDI items in the structured voice tracks as lilypond
          fragments (see section~\ref{section:exportLilypond}),

    \item repeatedly import the MIDI file generated by \ltbvc\ into
          special project tracks e.g. for a detailed comparison with
          the structured voice tracks (see
          section~\ref{section:importMidi}), and

    \item adjust the effect names of the SoX effects in the DAW to the
          command line fragments needed when doing an external
          rendering (see section~\ref{section:adjustSoXEffectNames})
          and also make all of them available in a dialog windows.

\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{figure:structuredVoiceTracks} shows the
structuring of the demo song from the \ltbvc.  Note that this Reaper
DAW file is also included in the current distribution.


%--------------------------------------
\section{AdaptTracksToLTBVCConventions}
\label{section:adaptTrackLayouts}
%--------------------------------------

When a project in a DAW is aimed at emulating the \ltbvc\ tool chain,
it is helpful to organize the tracks in a certain manner.

There are seven groups of tracks:
\begin{itemize}

    \item (optional) tracks with original audio as reference material,
    
    \item structured MIDI voice tracks that contain MIDI data for the
          voices and have loops or aliases indicating the musical
          structure of voice/song (with MIDI converted to audio by some
          VST instrument),

    \item MIDI voice tracks generated by the ``midi'' phase of the 
          external tool chain (where all structure is expanded, but
          the MIDI data should be almost identical to the structured
          MIDI tracks see~\ref{section:importMidi}), which also have
          their MIDI converted to audio by some VST instrument,

    \item raw audio voice tracks generated by the ``rawaudio'' phase
          of the external tool chain (where MIDI is rendered as audio
          but no SoX effects have been applied),

    \item plain effect voice tracks containing all the SoX effects
          applied to each voice similar to the ``refinedaudio'' phase
          of the external tool chain,

    \item refined audio voice tracks generated by the
          ``refinedaudio'' phase of the external tool chain (as
          reference tracks), and

    \item final audio voice tracks where refined audio is panned and
          has its volume adjusted for the final mix

\end{itemize}

Each group has its own ``folder track'' such that they can be
individually muted.

This project structure seems to be overly complex, but the idea behind
that is to factor out commonalities between the tracks.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \centeredExternalPicture{0.6}
                            {adaptStructure-tracks.png}
    \caption{Audio Routing Along Voice Tracks}
    \label{figure:adaptStructure-tracks}
\end{centeredFigure}

For each voice the following is done (as shown in
figure~\ref{figure:adaptStructure-tracks}):
\begin{itemize}

    \item The structured MIDI track, the generated MIDI track and the
          raw audio track are routed into the plain SoX effect track
          for that voice.  Routing is pre-FX for the raw audio track
          and post-FX for both the MIDI tracks.

          This means that the identical SoX effect chain is applied to
          all those audio source.  Because the MIDI tracks have a
          FluidSynthPlugin as their MIDI-to-audio converter, in
          principle all those tracks should provide the same audio
          signal (apart from the missing humanization in the
          structured track).

    \item The output of the voice SoX effect track and the refined
          audio track are both routed into the voice mix track to have
          pan and volume applied for the final mix.  Routing is pre-FX
          for the refined audio track and post-FX for the effect track.

          As an additional trick the refined audio track is phase
          inverted.  This means that when both effect track and
          refined audio track deliver some audio signal, \textbf{those
          should completely cancel out}.  This helps when checking
          whether the internal and external effects chain is
          identical.

    \item Finally all voice mix tracks are mixed into the (stereo)
          master track post-fader.

\end{itemize}

It is also clear, that not all tracks need all kinds of interaction,
for example in the mixer panel.  An effect track or a raw audio track
does not have to have a volume fader or a pan control because those
are handled in the voice mix track.  A raw or refined audio track does
not need any effects: its media is just routed into another track
following.

Hence it is helpful to change the appearance of the tracks
accordingly.  Reaper allows to customize the track layout as required,
so there is a layout style to be preferably applied to an
\ltbvc\ project.

The whole proceedure looks tedious: routing tracks and setting their
layout to reflect their function manually.

Fortunately the script \embeddedCode{AdaptTracksToLTBVCConventions}
does all that.  It connects tracks as given in
figure~\ref{figure:adaptStructure-tracks} via some naming conventions
and also applies track layouts to them.

Both naming convention and layout assignment is handled by the script
based on a so-called ``configuration file''.  This is a text file that
defines several variables and is either located in the script
directory or in the directory \embeddedCode{.luasettings} in the
user's home directory.  (For a detailed description of configuration
files see the
\ltbvc\ documentation~\cite{reference:lilypondToBandVideoConverter}.)

The variables relevant for this script are
\embeddedCode{trackKindToNamePatternMap},
\embeddedCode{trackNamePatternWithParentDisabledList}, and
\embeddedCode{track\-Name\-Pattern\-To\-Connection\-Data\-Map}.

\embeddedCode{trackNamePatternToConnectionDataMap} tells the routing
partners for specific name patterns signifying track categories
(e.g. effects or raw audio tracks).  The variable maps each of those
category track name pattern (in convention of the programming language
Lua) as the connection source onto a capturing pattern giving the
destination track name together with the position of the send and the
information whether some phase inversion is done.

For example, the map entry
\begin{configurationFileCode}
    "'^E%s+(%S.*)' : [ '^F%s+%1', 'postFX', true  ],"
\end{configurationFileCode}
tells that an effect track (starting with an ``E'' character and some
white space followed by the voice name) is connected to a correspondig
track starting with an ``F'' letter and some white space followed by
the same track name.  Routing is post-FX and a phase inversion is also
applied.

Hence the default variable definition matching figure might look like
\begin{configurationFileCode}
    trackNamePatternToConnectionDataMap = "{"
        "'^E%s+(%S.*)' : [ '^F%s+%1', 'postFX', false ],"
        "'^M%s+(%S.*)' : [ '^E%s+%1', 'postFX', false ],"
        "'^RA%s+(%S.*)': [ '^E%s+%1', 'preFX',  false ],"
        "'^RF%s+(%S.*)': [ '^F%s+%1', 'preFX',  true  ],"
        "'^S%s+(%S.*)' : [ '^E%s+%1', 'postFX', false ]"
    "}"
\end{configurationFileCode}

That default naming convention for the track routing assumes track
names as given by the table in
figure~\ref{figure:adaptStructure-naming}.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \bgroup\small
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            \bf TRACK KIND&\bf TRACK NAME PREFIX\\\hline\hline
            original track&O\blank\\\hline
            structured MIDI track&S\blank\\\hline
            generated MIDI track&M\blank\\\hline
            raw audio track&RA\blank\\\hline
            effect track&E\blank\\\hline
            refined audio track&RF\blank\\\hline
            mix track&M\blank\\\hline
        \end{tabular}
    \egroup
    \caption{Default Naming Conventions for Tracks}
    \label{figure:adaptStructure-naming}
\end{centeredFigure}

The variable \embeddedCode{trackNamePatternWithParentDisabledList}
gives a list of patterns for tracks names that are not directly
connected to the master track.

So for example the setting
\begin{configurationFileCode}
    trackNamePatternWithParentDisabledList = "["
        "'^E%s+%S.*$', '^RA%s+%S.*$'," ...
    "]"
\end{configurationFileCode}
makes sure that effect tracks as well as raw audio track (with the
convention from above!) are not connected to the master track.

\embeddedCode{trackNamePatternToColorAndLayoutMap} is a map with each
entry being a regular expression string mapped onto a pair of colour
and name of some layout in Reaper.

For example, the entry
\begin{configurationFileCode}
    "'^E%s+': [ 0xFF8080, 'gf - Effect Bus' ]"
\end{configurationFileCode}
tells that a track with name starting with ``E'' followed by at least
one blank shall be set to colour light blue (=0xFF8080 in
BGR-notation) and to a layout named ``gf - Effect Bus''.

So the variable could be set to
\begin{configurationFileCode}
    trackNamePatternToColorAndLayoutMap = "{"
        "'^EFFECTS': [ 0xFF0000, 'gc - Grouping without FX'],"
        "'^E%s+':    [ 0xFF8080, 'gf - Effect Bus' ]"
    "}"
\end{configurationFileCode}

When the script is run on the demo project, the routing is adapted (as
shown in figure~\ref{figure:adaptStructure-tracks}) and the mixer will
look like shown in figure~\ref{figure:adaptStructure-mixer}.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \centeredExternalPicture{0.45}
                            {adaptStructure-mixer.png}
    \caption{Standardized \ltbvc\ Track Layout in Mixer}
    \label{figure:adaptStructure-mixer}
\end{centeredFigure}


%-----------------------------
\section{ExportLilypond}
\label{section:exportLilypond}
%-----------------------------

The command here is applied to some selected MIDI item and transforms
its notes into a textual lilypond note/chord sequence and finally
returns it in the Reaper message box.  One can then copy the text into
the clipboard and insert it into a lilypond file for the song and
later processing by the \ltbvc.

The notes produced by the script are in English notation.  That means
for example, an \(f\sharp\) (\textbf{f~s}harp) note is ``fs'', an
\(e\flat\) (\textbf{e~f}lat) note is ``ef''.  The algorithm analyzes
the underlying MIDI notes along the measures and groups them into the
least possible number of notes still conforming to score guidelines.
Chords are automatically detected.

This generation of notes is dependent on a line in the project
settings defining the key.  E.g.\ the line \embeddedCode{key=f} in
figure~\ref{figure:exportLilypond-settings} defines the key of some
song to be ``f'' (major).  Only major keys can be defined, but,
however, this only affects whether accidentals used shall be sharps or
flats.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \centeredExternalPicture{\prefsScalingFactor}
                            {exportLilypond-settings.png}
    \caption{Key Definition for ExportLilypond}
    \label{figure:exportLilypond-settings}
\end{centeredFigure}

All instruments have a default octave defined by their names, where
the note sequences start as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bass, keyboardBottom \arrowTo\ \(C_1\),
    \item keyboard \arrowTo\ \(C_2\),
    \item guitar, keyboardTop, strings \arrowTo\ \(C_3\),
    \item vocals \arrowTo\ \(C_4\), and
    \item drums, percussion \arrowTo\ drum clef
\end{itemize}

So, for example, a guitar fragment will start with the lilypond text
\embeddedCode{\bsl relative~c'} (\(= C_3\)), a bass fragment with
\embeddedCode{\bsl relative~c,} (\(= C_1\)).

Activating the action on some MIDI item puts the resulting MIDI
fragment into the message box as shown in
figure~\ref{figure:exportLilypond-bass}.

\begin{centeredFigure}

                            {exportLilypond-results_bass.png}
    \caption{Exporting a Bass MIDI Item}
    \label{figure:exportLilypond-bass}
\end{centeredFigure}

Doing the same for some drum MIDI item puts the resulting MIDI
fragment also into the message box as shown in
figure~\ref{figure:exportLilypond-drums}, but uses drum notation
instead.  This is triggered by the item name starting with either
``drums '' or ``percussion ''.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \centeredExternalPicture{\tcpScalingFactor}
                            {exportLilypond-results_drums.png}
    \caption{Exporting a Drums MIDI Item}
    \label{figure:exportLilypond-drums}
\end{centeredFigure}

The durations in the output are optimized for being conformant to
standard notation practice and also switch from and to triplets when
appropriate.

A note will be split into parts tied together when its duration is not
allowed its start position due to notation standards.  For example,
when in a measure a quarter note follows a sixteenth note, it will be
split into a sixteenth note and a dotted eighth note to conform to
notation guidelines.  Figure~\ref{figure:exportLilypond-noteSplit}
shows how a simple note sequence is transformed by the algorithm.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \externalPicture{0.7}{exportLilypond-noteSplitA.png}
        &\qquad
        &\externalPicture{0.7}{exportLilypond-noteSplitB.png}\\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Splitting Notes on Musical Raster Positions}
    \label{figure:exportLilypond-noteSplit}
\end{centeredFigure}

Note that the minimum note duration allowed is a \(32^{nd}\)-note or a
\(32^{nd}\)-triplet.  If the item converted is not quantized
accordingly, typically some strange note durations like ``e?77?'' will
occur in the result where this signifies a note with a duration of 77
MIDI ticks (which is 77/240 of a quarter note) that cannot be split
into meaningful durations.

\section{ImportMidi}
\label{section:importMidi}
%-------------------------

The \ltbvc\ pipeline produces a temporary MIDI file with some
humanization applied.  It is helpful to import that file into tracks
repeatedly to see the consequences of changes in the lilypond file.

Doing this manually is tedious, especially because MIDI tracks in the
project may be at arbitrary positions.

Fortunately the tracks generated by the \ltbvc\ have a predictable
structure and naming of tracks.  Hence this script scans the DAW
project for tracks conforming to that convention: those are tracks
with a single MIDI item, where its item name ends with ``.mid'' and it
gives the voice name followed by the name of the MIDI file.

For example, a MIDI item ``bass - wonderful\_song-std.mid'' is the
bass voice in an imported MIDI file ``wonderful\_song-std.mid'' from
the \ltbvc.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \centeredExternalPicture{\prefsScalingFactor}
                            {importMidi-settings.png}
    \caption{Relative Path Definition for MIDI Import}
    \label{figure:importMIDI-settings}
\end{centeredFigure}

For the import the location of the MIDI file has to be specified; this
is done by the configuration variable \embeddedCode{midiFilePath} in
the project settings (see figure~\ref{figure:importMIDI-settings}).
It gives the relative path of the directory containing the MIDI file
from \ltbvc.

The processing by the script is as follows:
\begin{itemize}

    \item The referenced MIDI file is imported into new temporary tracks.

    \item All existing tracks with matching names (``\meta{instrument
          name} - \meta{MIDI file name}'' are updated from the imported
          tracks.

    \item The new temporary tracks are deleted.

    \item Some filtering is done on the imported MIDI items: pan,
          reverb and volume control codes are removed (because they
          shall be provided by DAW controls and effects).

    \item All those items are set to ``locked'' (because they should
          not be changed manually, because they will be overwritten by
          the next import).

\end{itemize}

The example song has four MIDI tracks for each of the voices;
figure~\ref{figure:importMIDI-tracks} shows those tracks, their items
with the appropriated names in the demo Reaper project.

\begin{centeredFigure}
    \centeredExternalPicture{\tcpScalingFactor}
                            {importMidi-tracks.png}
    \caption{``Updateable'' MIDI Tracks of Demo Song}
    \label{figure:importMIDI-tracks}
\end{centeredFigure}


%--------------------------------------------
\section{MakeRegionsFromRegionStructureTrack}
\label{section:makeRegions}
%--------------------------------------------

As mentioned in section~\ref{section:exportLilypond} it is practical
to structure the MIDI items according to the song structure.  Reaper
provides so-called \emph{regions} along the timeline, which are very
helpful in organizing a project.

Unfortunately they are a bit tedious to use: duplicating them or
coloring them requires many clicks even when you use the
``Region/Marker Manager'' of Reaper.

The script \embeddedCode{MakeRegionsFromRegionStructureTrack}
simplifies this at the expense of using another track with the region
information encoded into items.  It makes regions from the MIDI items
in a track called ``STRUCTURE'' by copying their positions and also
reuses their coloring and naming.  So you can quickly adjust the MIDI
items in the structure track and then regenerate the regions from it.

It is also possible to vice versa generate that ``STRUCTURE'' track
with this script.

When the script is started the dialog of
figure~\ref{figure:makeRegions-dialog} appears.
\begin{centeredFigureHere}
    \centeredExternalPicture{0.7}{makeRegions-dialog.png}
    \caption{Selection Dialog for MakeRegionsFromRegionStructureTrack}
    \label{figure:makeRegions-dialog}
\end{centeredFigureHere}

Depending on the selection (assuming you do not select cancel) the
following happens:
\begin{itemize}

    \item For a selection of ``Yes'' (create regions) a track called
          ``STRUCTURE'' is searched for.  First each region is
          deleted.  Then for each MIDI item on that track a new region
          is created having the same start time, end time, name and
          color as the item.

    \item For a selection of ``No'' (create structure track) a track
          called ``STRUCTURE'' is searched for and is created if
          non-existent.  Each existing MIDI item on that track is
          deleted.  Then for each region a new MIDI item is created on
          that track having the same start time, end time, name and
          color as the region.

\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{figure:makeRegions-tracks} shows the structure track and
the generated regions for the demo song.

\begin{centeredFigureHere}
    \centeredExternalPicture{0.55}{makeRegions-tracks.png}
    \caption{Regions and Structure Track in Comparison}
    \label{figure:makeRegions-tracks}
\end{centeredFigureHere}


%---------------------------------------
\section{NormalizeStructuredVoiceTracks}
\label{section:normalizeTracks}
%---------------------------------------

The list of MIDI items for the structured approach as describe in
section~\ref{section:exportLilypond} should be located in tracks that
adhere to some naming pattern.

In that case, the script \embeddedCode{NormalizeStructuredVoiceTracks}
can be used.  It scans all MIDI items in structured MIDI voice tracks
and normalizes their note velocity, quantizes note to the raster
necessary for later export and removes unwanted MIDI control events.

Only those MIDI items in tracks are considered whose track names
conform to a certain naming pattern.  That pattern is ---~as with
other scripts~--- defined in a line in the project settings using the
variable \embeddedCode{structuredMidiTrackNamePattern} and it
specifies the regular expression a voice track name has to match.  For
example, the line
\embeddedCode{structuredMidiTrackNamePattern="S\textvisiblespace.*"}
in figure~\ref{figure:normalizeStructuredTracks-settings} defines the
name pattern for the voice track names to be ``S\textvisiblespace.*''.
This means the name of a voice structure track must start with a
capital ``S'' followed by a blank character.  Note that that is the
default when you do not specify any pattern.

\begin{centeredFigureHere}
    \centeredExternalPicture{\prefsScalingFactor}
                            {normalizeStructuredTracks-settings.png}
    \caption{Settings for Selection of Structured MIDI Tracks}
    \label{figure:normalizeStructuredTracks-settings}
\end{centeredFigureHere}

Each MIDI item in the voice structure tracks is transformed as
follows:
\begin{itemize}

    \item Note velocities are set to a default value (80).

    \item Note positions and lengths are moved to the raster necessary
          for later lilypond export by the script
          \embeddedCode{Exportlilypond}.

    \item MIDI control codes for volume, pan and reverb are removed
          (because they shall be provided by DAW controls and effects).

\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------
\section{AdjustSoXEffectNames}
\label{section:adjustSoXEffectNames}
%-----------------------------------

In the ``refinedaudio'' phase of the external tool chain \SoX\ is used
for applying audio effects to the raw audio.  In the DAW the
\SoX\ plugins from \cite{reference:soxPlugins} emulate the external
\SoX\ program bit-identically.

When tweaking the \SoX\ plugins, the command lines for the
\SoX\ program can be easily extracted from the DAW.  This is done by
the script \embeddedCode{AdjustSoXEffectNames}.

The script does two things:
\begin{itemize}

    \item The correct command line text for the corresponding
          \SoX\ effect is used as the name of the \SoX\ plugin in the
          DAW.

    \item For all tracks containing \SoX\ plugins, track name and the
          command line for the effects are written into Reaper's
          message window.

\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{figure:adjustSoXEffectNames} shows an example of the
command line generation for a \SoX\ phaser effect.

%==================
\chapter{Demo Song}
%==================

Included in this installation is a Reaper demo file with tracks for
the demo song of the \ltbvc.

The following tracks are contained in the project:
\begin{itemize}

    \item a region structure track,

    \item structured voice tracks for all four voices (vocals, bass,
          guitar and drums) routed to the corresponding effect tracks,

    \item the MIDI tracks from the generated MIDI file routed to the
          corresponding effect tracks,

    \item raw audio tracks (generated by the \ltbvc\ pipeline) routed
          to the corresponding effect tracks,

    \item effect tracks enhancing MIDI or raw audio tracks, and

    \item refined audio tracks (generated by the \ltbvc\ pipeline)

\end{itemize}

Because this project file should work with a standard Reaper
installation without any additional plugins, the MIDI to audio
conversion is done with the stock \embeddedCode{ReaSamplOmatic} plugin
plus some external samples; also the audio effects for refinement are
stock effects.  This is acceptable for trying out the plugins
described in this document, but does not faithfully reproduce the sound
of the external pipeline.

For a realistic impression of the external MIDI to audio conversion,
one also needs a soundfont player fully compatible with the fluidsynth
player~\cite{reference:fluidsynth} used in the \ltbvc\ pipeline.  One
candidate is the FluidSynthPlugin that almost faithfully emulates the
external fluidsynth player (apart from some deviations described in
its documentation \cite{reference:fluidsynthPluginsRepository}).

If you want to emulate the \SoX\ effects from the external pipeline
(as mentioned in the \ltbvc\ documentations) you'll have to install
specific \SoX\ emulation plugins (for example, the \SoX\ plugins from
\cite{reference:soxPlugins}) and then adapt the effect tracks
accordingly.


%===========================
\chapter{Coping with Errors}
%===========================

If one of the scripts does not work as expected or even issues an
error message, how can you find out what really went wrong?

All the scripts do some fine-grained entry-exit-tracing of relevant
function calls into a log file; its last lines should give you some
indication about the error.

The log files are written into a directory given by the environment
variables \embeddedCode{REAPERLOGS}, \embeddedCode{TEMP} and
\embeddedCode{TMP} (in the order given).  If none of those variables
is set, the directory ``/tmp'' is used.

The log file name is ``reaper\_'' followed by the script name, so, for
example, the script exportLilypond writes its log to the file
``reaper\_exportLilypond.log'' in the directory given by one of the
environment variables given above.

Figure~\ref{figure:logging} shows how a log file looks like.  Each
line shows either an entry of a function (``\(>>\)''), an exit from
a function (``\(<<\)'') and a log line within a function
(``\(--\)'') together with a time indication.
